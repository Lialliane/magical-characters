## What observations or questions do you have about what you've learned so far?

#### In this assignment, I didn’t encounter many new concepts regarding layout or filtering, aside from making grids and using `<select>` for filtering. The main difference from my past API work was using fetch() directly rather than via AJAX. I’m still unclear on the practical differences between the two approaches and in which scenarios AJAX might still be preferable.

## How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And how long did you expect it to take?

#### It took around 10 hours to complete, while I initially expected it to take about 3 hours. The extra time was due to design adjustments and searching for appropriate assets, which I underestimated at the start.
