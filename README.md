# My-Tasks

## What observations or questions do you have about what you've learned so far?

### Through this assignment, I explored a range of new front-end skills. I learned how to use sliders in HTML/CSS, revised core HTML/CSS/JavaScript concepts, and practiced organizing my code better. I also experimented with pixel-style design and custom visuals, which taught me that creating a cohesive and good-looking interface takes significantly more time than expected — especially when building everything from scratch. I also picked up a few new JavaScript and CSS tricks along the way.

### This process made me more aware of how much work goes into small visual details and how helpful it can be to build on top of an existing design rather than starting from zero.

## How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And how long did you expect it to take?

### I initially expected it to take around 6–8 hours, but it ended up taking closer to 18 hours. A big part of that was the design work and tweaking small visual details — which, although time-consuming, was a valuable learning experience.
